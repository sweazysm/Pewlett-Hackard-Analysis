# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview 

The client, Pewlett-Hackard (PH), has asked for an analysis of their employees in order to find out which are eligible for retirement. From this, PH has decided to begin a new mentorship program which puts retired full-time employees in a part-time position to mentor the incoming staffing that will take their position. The amount of employees retiring is large, leading to the term of "silver-tsunami" being used in regards to the upcoming retirement wave from PH. From the analysis performed, the number of employees retiriing per title was determined as well as those eligible to participate in PH's mentorship program.

## Results

The two specific tasks conducted are as follows:

- Determine the number of retiring employees by title
- Determine the number of employees eligibile for PH's mentorship program

The first tasked entailed determining the number of employees retiring by title. Over 90,000 employees are retiring! Specifically, we have 29414 Senior Engineers retiring; 28254 Senior Staff members retiring; 14222 Engineers retiring; 12243 Staff members retiring; 4502 Techniques Leaders retiring; 1761 Assistant Engineers retiring; and 2 Managers are retiring. The majorty of people retiring are either Senior Staff or Senior Engineers, which may mean that existing Engineers and Staff could look forward to a promotion. All in all, there is no joke about a "Silver Tsunami."

The second task entaled determining the number of employees eligible for PH's mentorship program. Through the analysis, it is found that there are just oover 1500 employees eligible for PH's mentorship program! This means that the majority of PH's retiring employees will not be eligible for the mentorship program, meaning that a lot of work will have to be done by the mentors. Roughly 1500 mentors for roughly 90000 positions, there will be work to be done! If this can be kept as a part-time position remains to be seen as only time will tell!

What can be drawn from the Analysis is as follows:
- Roughly 90000 employees are up for retirement at PH 
- Of those 90000 employees, roughly 1500 are eligible for the mentorship program
- The majority of those retiring (by title) are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff members
- If the numbers match up, this means that each mentor could have dozens of people under their wings to mentor. Can this really be kept as a part-time position?
